# **App Name**: Rally World

## Core Features:

- Rally Management: Create a web application for managing a rally sport competition. The app should include features for: - User Authentication and Roles: Support different user roles such as 'fan', 'competitor', 'timekeeper', and 'organizer', with varying permissions. Organizers should be able to set user roles. - Competitor Management: Allow organizers to manage competitor profiles and potentially associate them with specific stages or events. - Stage Management: Enable organizers to define and manage stages of the rally. - Timekeeping: Provide an interface for timekeepers to record and manage times for competitors during stages. - News Feed/Posts: Include a system for posting updates or news related to the rally, possibly with different post types (e.g., system updates). - Admin Interface: A dedicated section for administrators or organizers to manage users, roles, and potentially other aspects of the competition. - Data Storage: Utilize a database (like Firestore based on your files) to store user information, roles, competition data (stages, times, etc.), and posts. - Cloud Functions: Implement backend logic using cloud functions (like Firebase Functions based on your files) for tasks such as setting user roles and processing stage completion data. The app should have a clear and intuitive user interface, with separate sections or views for different user roles. Consider using a modern JavaScript framework (like React based on your files) for the frontend.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: muted red/burgundy (#7b5f64) to convey reliability and speed.
- Background color: dark gray-blue (#15151c) for a clean, modern look.
- Accent color: Red for call-to-action elements, giving a dynamic and energetic feeling.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a techy, modern feel. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a neutral, readable appearance.
- Use a set of flat, outlined icons that reflect the rally sport's dynamic and adventurous nature.
- Maintain a clear, structured layout with ample spacing to improve readability and user experience. Use card-based design to present stage and competitor information.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions for interactive elements. Examples: button hover effects and smooth loading transitions between sections.
